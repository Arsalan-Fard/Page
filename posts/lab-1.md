In this tutorial, we will create a personal website using GitHub Pages. Follow the steps below to set up your site:

1. First, we create a repository and upload our code.

5. Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.

6. Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.

7. Visit `username.github.io` to view your new website. Note that it can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.
